# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the ControlNet integration issues in the AI art generation system and improves the overall reliability and error handling of the drawing application. The system currently fails when attempting to generate images due to missing ControlNet scripts in the Stable Diffusion backend, resulting in HTTP 422 errors. This feature will implement proper error handling, fallback mechanisms, and improved integration with the Stable Diffusion API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user drawing sketches in the application, I want the system to successfully generate AI art from my drawings even when certain Stable Diffusion extensions are unavailable, so that I can consistently create artwork without technical failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ControlNet extension is not available THEN the system SHALL fallback to standard text-to-image generation with the user's sketch as a reference
2. WHEN the API request fails with a 422 error THEN the system SHALL retry with a simplified payload that doesn't require ControlNet
3. WHEN any API error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message instead of generic error codes
4. WHEN the fallback mechanism is used THEN the system SHALL log the fallback reason for debugging purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the AI art system, I want comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the image generation pipeline, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API request is made THEN the system SHALL log the request payload and response for debugging
2. WHEN an error occurs during image generation THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including status codes, error messages, and request context
3. WHEN the system encounters network timeouts THEN it SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN multiple consecutive failures occur THEN the system SHALL temporarily disable image generation and notify the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the drawing application, I want the system to validate my inputs and provide clear feedback before attempting to generate images, so that I don't waste time on requests that will fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to submit without required selections THEN the system SHALL display specific validation messages indicating what is missing
2. WHEN the canvas is empty or contains insufficient drawing data THEN the system SHALL warn the user before proceeding
3. WHEN the selected style or prompt combination is known to cause issues THEN the system SHALL suggest alternatives
4. WHEN the backend service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL detect this and inform the user rather than attempting the request

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user generating AI art, I want the system to provide multiple generation options and configurations, so that I can achieve the artistic results I'm looking for even when the primary method fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ControlNet is unavailable THEN the system SHALL offer alternative generation methods including standard txt2img and img2img
2. WHEN a generation method fails THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest and allow switching to alternative methods
3. WHEN using fallback methods THEN the system SHALL adjust generation parameters appropriately for the chosen method
4. WHEN multiple generation options are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose their preferred method in settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to gracefully handle different Stable Diffusion configurations and extensions, so that the system works across various deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL probe the Stable Diffusion API to detect available extensions and capabilities
2. WHEN ControlNet is detected as available THEN the system SHALL use the enhanced ControlNet payload
3. WHEN ControlNet is not available THEN the system SHALL automatically configure itself to use standard generation methods
4. WHEN the API configuration changes THEN the system SHALL re-detect capabilities without requiring a restart
